BATTLESTAR
==========
A multiplayer game based on Battlestar lore.

Authors: David Gay, Scott Gunther, Yigit Katkici, Nathan Osborn

In this tactical strategy, two players choose Human or Cylon and battle it out.
The Cylons attempt to destroy the 12 colonies, and the Humans do their
best to reach Earth. Of course, the Humans also need to protect the 12
colonies and the Cylons must stop the Humans...

For a basic Java course, there isn't a need for everyone to learn Git.
Therefore, I will be maintaining the repo with our most current work.
Of course, if anyone else gets a handle on Git and learns to properly push
their own work (to a seperate branch, please), even better. :)
