A multiplayer game based on Battlestar lore.

Authors: David Gay, Scott Gunther, Yigit Katkici, Nathan Osborn

Gameplay
--------

In this tactical strategy, two players choose Human or Cylon and battle it out.
Players are given control of 8 basic ships, 4 special ships, and a main ship.
Victory is achieved by destroying your opponent's main ship (the Cylons must
destroy the Humans' Galactica, and the Humans must destroy the Cylons'
Basestar).

Development
-----------

For a basic Java course, there isn't a need for everyone to learn Git.
Therefore, I will be maintaining the repo with our most current work.
Of course, if anyone else gets a handle on Git and learns to properly push
their own work (to a seperate branch, please), even better. :)
