BattleClient
1. Added instance variable "id" to keep track of id
2. Added instance variable "jfWait" the frame for waiting
3. Added instance variable "lblWait" the label that says waiting
4. Commented out this.setVisible(true) after GUI elements are created
	This is because the client now waits for the S_INITIALIZE command
	this command is sent by the server after 2 clients have connected
5. Added choose race method which allows the user to pick the race and
	then asks if the user is ready.
6. Added code for handling the S_INITIALIZE command
7. Added code for handling the S_ID command
8. Changed code in the S_RACE command because the Strings that 
	the command was being compared to are no longer instance varaibles.

	because I don't want to reset everything for a new game
10. Added code for handling the S_WIN command - program exits like the lose
11. In the S_TRUN command handling added statusBar messages to help users know its their turn
